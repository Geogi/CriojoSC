CriojoSC
==========

CriojoSC is an implementation of CRIOJO, a CHAM-based engine for running concurrent applications with guaranteed causal order. It sounds cool, but it's far from complete at the moment.

CriojoSC uses [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and is [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) licenced.

Some useful resources:
* The mainline implementation by Mayleen Lacouture: [maylencita/CRIOJO](https://github.com/maylencita/CRIOJO/tree/version2.0)
* The latest CRIOJO research paper: http://hal.inria.fr/hal-00676083/

Building
--------
The build chain is currently in disarray, and will be until I complete the switch to SBT.
Use 62473a6c60f9d70b3408141ef4c693220928b0cc if needed.

Generating the API
------------------
Same as Building above.

Using
-----
It's really unstable and partially unimplemented, so writing a tutorial at this point isn't sensible.

Refer to the API documentation if needed.
