/** A symbolic representation of an [[fr.emn.criojosc.Relation]], as used in rule premises and "where" guards.<br />
  * The engine matches it against the actual instances in [[fr.emn.criojosc.EntitySymbol]] to produce a
  * [[fr.emn.criojosc.Valuation]], used by most [[fr.emn.criojosc.Guard]]s and
  * [[fr.emn.criojosc.Rule]] conclusions.
  *
  * Note that while [[fr.emn.criojosc.AtomPattern]] is not typed itself, it is created by
  * an AtomN ([[fr.emn.criojosc.Atom0]], [[fr.emn.criojosc.Atom1]], etc) that
  * is typed, ensuring a consistent state.<br />
  * This is why instances of this class should not be created manually, but using `Atom.apply` (arity > 0) or
  * `Atom0.unary_~`.
  *
  * @param symbol The Atom this particular representation refers to.
  * @param patterns The list of [[fr.emn.criojosc.Pattern]]s used by the matching process.
