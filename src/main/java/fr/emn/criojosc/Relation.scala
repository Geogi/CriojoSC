/** An atom identifier, which can create [[fr.emn.criojosc.OpenAtom]]s and

  *
  * Use the companion object to create new instances of `Atom`, as it will transparently instantiate
  * [[fr.emn.criojosc.Relation]] with the right type.
  *
  * Usage:
  * {{{
  * val R = Relation[Int]          // Relation
  * val p = Var[Int]               // Pattern
  * R(p)                           // OpenAtom (argument is a Pattern)
  * R(!p)                          // ClosedAtom (argument is not a Pattern)
  * }}}
