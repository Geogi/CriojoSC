/** An instance of an [[fr.emn.criojosc.Relation]] in a given state (a list of an unbound type).<br />

  * (listed in its conclusion).
  *
  * Note that while [[fr.emn.criojosc.AtomInstance]] is not typed itself, it is created by
  * an `AtomN` ([[fr.emn.criojosc.Atom0]], [[fr.emn.criojosc.Atom1]], etc) that
  * is typed, ensuring a consistent state.<br />
  * This is why instances of this class should not be created manually, but using `Atom.apply` (arity > 0) or
  * `Atom0.unary_!`.
  *
  * @param symbol The Atom this instance refers to.
  * @param values The list of values (unbound type) that defines the state of this instance.
